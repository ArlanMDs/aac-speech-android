* enable installing apps from not-verified-sources (Settings->Applications; tick 'Unknown sources')
* Download and install the latest apk: https://github.com/vidma/aac-speech-android/raw/master/acc_speech_latest.apk
* Install gesture search http://www.google.com/mobile/gesture-search/  or from android market: https://market.android.com/details?id=com.google.android.apps.gesturesearch
(note the tablets I tested the app with did not support Gesture Search -- you will get some more poor homemade search capabilities)
* Run the app; then go to application's Menu->Preferences and click on 'Install pictograms'.

to use French you have to set your phone/tablet language to French for now.

English support is very experimental (go to preferences->language).
