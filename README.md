AAC app for children with speech disabilities
=============================================

ABOUT
-----

An Android application for children with speech disabilities,  a generic and easy to learn communication method for anyone with speech disabilities that forms sentences from a list of pictograms clicked. It is different from most of existing products by being free, by it's natural language processing features (inflection, tenses, using the setting user gender to alter first person sentences1 and more) and by usage of gesture search on mobile phones where keyboard is not reliable because is small screen.

The application includes ~5000 icons obtained from arasaac.org, where ~900 are properly categorized, and others are accessible through search. It supports French language well, and there is an early prototype for English too.

Other features include:

* recent phrases and pictogram history (each category lists most used ones on top)
accessibility
* for easier identification icons tagged with the 6 SPC colors (actions, names, descriptives etc)
* option to display text in capital letters
* compatibility with both Tablets and mobile phones

Also, my friends have found it to be a fun toy to learn basics of foreign language :)


Below application screen-shots on mobile phone. On tablet everything is bigger and fits more icons.

(note the tablets I tested the app with did not support Gesture Search -- you will get some more poor homemade search capabilities)

to use French you have to set your phone/tablet language to French for now.

English support is very experimental (go to preferences->language).
